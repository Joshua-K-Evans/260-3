# 260-3
This lab took a code scaffolding in C and after filled out completely was used to create an alarm system. The alarm system worked by using 3 reed switches that were turned high or low using magnets. By setting the circuits to “Active High”, we set up the code around that to notice what signal the reed switches are outputting in order to see if it triggers the alarms to go off. There is an arm button and a reset button as well as LEDs to be programmed to light up in the event that the reed switch triggers an “open door/window” in the system. The key was getting the addresses and locations on the microcontroller correct so that the right parts of the hardware worked as expected.
